# OpenCV-FingerCounter
Using Open-CV to count the number of fingers a user is holding up

## What is this project

As a new cs student with a background in Python, I wanted to explore some of the languages applications and libraries. I am also interested in computer vision and machine learning. 

Disclaimer: This project is a part of a capstone from Jose Portilla's Udemy Course "Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning". This code is not original and the majority of it was written as I followed and progressed through the course.
